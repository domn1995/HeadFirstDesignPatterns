# HeadFirstDesignPatterns
This a C# port of the Java code from the Head First Design Patterns book.

The overall solution is organized into two parts: the design patterns and the usage examples.

The design patterns code are created as class library (.dll) projects and are then referenced by the TestDrive classes that run example programs demonstrating their usage.

To run each of the usage examples in Visual Studio, you need to right-click the desired project and select "Set as StartUp project."
